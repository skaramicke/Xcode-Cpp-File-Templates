# Xcode C++ File Templates

Currently this repository has 3 templates to help C++ coding with Xcode4+:

- C++ Class
- C++ Template Class
- C++ Header

All templates **support namespaces** and have toggable copy and move contructors/operators.

I have only tested on Xcode 5 and Xcode 6, but should work on Xcode 4 too.

If you wish to add those templates to your Xcode install, you can clone the git repo:

	git clone https://github.com/Rogiel/Xcode-Cpp-File-Templates.git ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/C++

Updating is even easier:

	cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/C++ && git pull origin

And your done! No need to restart Xcode.
